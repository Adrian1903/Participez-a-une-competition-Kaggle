- **row_id** : (int64) ID code for the row.
- **timestamp** : (int64) the time in milliseconds between this user interaction and the first event completion from that user.
- **user_id** : (int32) ID code for the user.
- **content_id** : (int16) ID code for the user interaction
- **content_type_id** : (int8) 0 if the event was a question being posed to the user, 1 if the event was the user watching a lecture.
- **task_container_id** : (int16) Id code for the batch of questions or lectures. For example, a user might see three questions in a row before seeing the explanations for any of them. Those three would all share a task_container_id.
- **user_answer** : (int8) the user's answer to the question, if any. Read -1 as null, for lectures.
- **answered_correctly** : (int8) if the user responded correctly. Read -1 as null, for lectures.
- **prior_question_elapsed_time** : (float32) The average time in milliseconds it took a user to answer each question in the previous question bundle, ignoring any lectures in between. Is null for a user's first question bundle or lecture. Note that the time is the average time a user took to solve each question in the previous bundle.
- **prior_question_had_explanation** : (bool) Whether or not the user saw an explanation and the correct response(s) after answering the previous question bundle, ignoring any lectures in between. The value is shared across a single question bundle, and is null for a user's first question bundle or lecture. Typically the first several questions a user sees were part of an onboarding diagnostic test where they did not get any feedback.
